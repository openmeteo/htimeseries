3.1.1 (2020-12-29)
==================

- Fixed incompatibility with pandas 1.2.

3.1.0 (2020-12-17)
==================

- When reading a time series from a file-like object, it is now
  permitted for it to not have a flags column. In this case, an empty
  flags column is automatically added to the HTimeseries object.

3.0.0 (2020-02-23)
==================

- Only Python>=3.7 is now supported.
- When reading or writing a time series, it now checks that there are no
  duplicate timestamps and raises an exception if there are.

2.0.5 (2020-01-15)
==================

- Fix pandas dependency to use pandas<1, so that Python 3.5
  compatibility is kept.

2.0.4 (2020-01-08)
==================

- Fixed crash when saving in version 2 and the time step was a mere "M"
  or "Y" without multiplier.

2.0.3 (2020-01-05)
==================

- Default version when writing file is now latest.

2.0.1 (2020-01-04)
==================

- Fixed error when the time step was empty.

2.0.0 (2020-01-04)
==================

- Changed the way the time step is specified. Instead of
  "minutes,months", it is now a pandas "frequency" offset specification
  such as "5min" or "3M".
- The timestamp_offset and timestamp_rounding parameters have been
  abolished.

1.1.2 (2019-07-18)
==================

- Fixed some altitude-related bugs: 1) It would crash when trying to
  read a file that specified altitude but not location; 2) it wouldn't
  write altitude to the file it the altitude was zero.

1.1.1 (2019-06-12)
==================

- Fixed crash when Timestamp_rounding=None or Timestamp_offset=None.

1.1.0 (2019-06-08)
==================

- Added TzinfoFromString utility (moved in here from pthelma).

1.0.1 (2019-06-06)
==================

- Fixed error in the README (which prevented 1.0.0 from being uploaded
  to PyPi).

1.0.0 (2019-06-06)
==================

- API change: .read() is gone, now we use a single overloaded
  constructor; either HTimeseries() or HTimeseries(dataframe) or 
  HTimeseries(filelike).
- The columns and dtypes of .data are now standardized and properly
  created even for empty objects (created with HTimeseries()).

0.2.0 (2019-04-09) 
==================

- Auto detect format when reading a file

0.1.0 (2019-01-14)
==================

- Initial release
